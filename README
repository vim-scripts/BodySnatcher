This plugin does a search of lines of a .html document and parses the statement of the <body> attributes. In modern times we prefer to use CSS to control presentational aspects of Web pages like text color, background, and link color.  When designing a site from scratch we'd plan that ahead of time. When updating a handful of pages that were not originally authored with CSS in mind, a script like this saves time by pulling out the expected HTML attributes and converting them to CSS declarations.
